My husband and our lovely daughter Isabelle at the Golden Gardens Park (2020), one of our favorite parks in Seattle.

Born and raised in China, lived in Poland, and living in the U.S., I have always been fascinated by cultural diversity. I enjoy outdoor activities (i.e. running, hiking, and snowboarding) and cooking during leisure time.
