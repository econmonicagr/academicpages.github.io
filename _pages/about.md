Welcome! 
======
I am an economist at the International Monetary Fund. I received my Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of Washington].

I am an applied macroeconomist with a [research portfolio](https://econmonicagr.github.io/research/) comprised of papers in international macroeconomics, macro-finance, and applied time-series analysis. And my passion is to develop theory-based policy implications through empirical work.
