Welcome! 
======
I received my Ph.D. in Economics at the [University of Washington](https://econ.washington.edu/). And I will be joining the Economist Program at the IMF in September 2021.

I am an applied macroeconomist with a [research portfolio](https://econmonicagr.github.io/research/) comprised of papers in international macroeconomics, macro-finance, and applied econometrics. And my passion is to develop theory-based policy implications through empirical work. My [job market paper](https://econmonicagr.github.io/files/MonicaGR_JMP.pdf) [[slides](https://econmonicagr.github.io/files/IMF Nowcasts_slides.pdf)] investigates the accuracy of IMF nowcasts in times of crises. This study provides guidance on how to further improve IMF nowcasts efficiency to better design and assess the loan programs, and ultimately help countries restore economic growth. The [second paper](https://econmonicagr.github.io/files/NOR_MaPP.pdf) in my dissertation empirically examines the role of macroprudential policy in addressing the effects of external shocks on financial stability.
